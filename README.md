# Getting started with .NET Aspire w/ Devcontainers

This is a repository template to streamline the process of getting started with .NET Aspire using Devontainers in both Visual Studio Code and GitHub Codespaces. Please refer to our product documentation on how to use these repository templates to get started.

- [.NET Aspire and GitHub Codespaces](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/aspire/get-started/github-codespaces)
- [.NET Aspire and Visual Studio Code Dev Containers](https://https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/aspire/get-started/dev-containers)

> NOTE: This repository is configured to use the latest daily builds of .NET Aspire. Use the https://github.com/dotnet/aspire-devcontainer repository as a template for the latest _released_ bits. If you are a member of the .NET Aspire team you can create a codespace directly from this repository to speed up the spin-up time for a Devcontainer for testing purposes.
