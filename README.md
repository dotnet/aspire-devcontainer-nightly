> NOTE: Once you have created your repository from this template please remember to review the included files such as `LICENSE`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `SECURITY.md` and this `README.md` file to ensure they are appropriate for your circumstances.

> NOTE: This repository is configured to use the latest daily builds of .NET Aspire. Use the https://github.com/dotnet/aspire-devcontainer repository as a template for the latest _released_ bits. If you are a member of the .NET Aspire team you can create a codespace directly from this repository to speed up the spin-up time for a Devcontainer for testing purposes. The `devcontainer.json` includes additional features which are more common for internal team testing scenarios.
